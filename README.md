vpnshift
========

*Don't depend on this for anything serious (yet). If you do use this,
make sure to verify that the VPN connection is active, since the network
namespace abstraction is leaky with real-world applications like Google
Chrome.*

vpnshift lets you run commands in an isolated network namespace with
openvpn.

This means that a program launched by vpnshift can conveniently have VPN
access while all other programs have normal internet access, without
resorting to running it under different user accounts or inside a
virtual machine.

This is particularly useful for not sending existing browser tabs or
long-running daemon traffic (like dropbox or syncthing) through your VPN.

    $ vpnshift -c myopenvpn.conf chromium --incognito
    starting openvpn..................
    <stdout and stderr from chromium>
    stopping openvpn...
    $

Once the command exits, openvpn is terminated and the namespace is torn
down.

For more usage information, run vpnshift with no arguments.

    $ vpnshift

Usage
--------

Apply VPN to a single process.

    $ sudo bash ./vpnshift -c <OVPN FILE> -i <INTERFACE> -u <USER> [<COMMAND> [<ARG>...]]

Establish a VPN network namespace..

    $ sudo bash ./vpnshift -c <OVPN FILE> -i <INTERFACE> -u <USER> ping google.com

..and attach multiple processes to it.
    
    $ ip netns list # list available network namespace
    $ sudo ip netns exec <network namespace> sudo -u <USER> [<COMMAND> [<ARG>...]]

Warnings
--------

Google Chrome and Chromium will breach the network namespace if you open
tabs both in the default namespace and inside vpnshift's namespace,
since they'll be in the same browsing session.

As a workaround, you can use completely separate browsers.

Alternatively, you can point Google Chrome/Chromium to a new
`--user-data-directory` manually (with that flag), or with
[chromeshift][].

Limitations
-----------
- Only one network namespace ("vpnshift") can currently be used. This
  will be expanded in the future so multiple VPNs can be run
  simultaneously.
- The subnet for the veth tunnel is hard-coded to 10.10.10.10/31.
  (Determining the IP addresses is a major paint-point of the bullet
  above.)
- DNS nameservers pushed by openvpn are not recognized properly. The
  nameservers are hard-coded to [cryptostorm's][cs] DNS: [cs-ussouth2][]
  (108.62.19.131) and [cs-uswest2][] (104.238.194.235). DNS traffic is
  still forwarded through the VPN.

Acknowledgements
----------------

I was first shown the power of network namespaces by [vpnns.sh][], which
inspired (and provided a helpful starting point) for vpnshift.  I used a
modified version of that script while I was still trying to get vpnshift
to work. The method is also detailed in a [blog post][] by the same author.
